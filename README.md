# SQL Queries on Chinook Database

This repository contains the SQL queries and notebooks used to complete the BUAN405 SQL Extraction assignment using the Chinook database. The project is divided into three Jupyter notebooks, each demonstrating SQL queries against the **Chinook.db** SQLite database.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates various SQL queries applied to the Chinook database, including:
- Track information retrieval and sorting
- Customer spending analysis
- Joining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights

## Repository Structure

- **BUAN405_Ch4Ex3.ipynb**: Contains queries related to track lengths, customer spending, artist searches, and track purchases.
- **BUAN405Ch4Ex4Part2.ipynb**: Contains queries to retrieve track information, album details, and artist-track relationships.
- **BUAN405Ch4Ex4Part3.ipynb**: Contains more advanced queries, including customer orders, track prices, album lengths, and customer analysis.

## Chinook Database

The Chinook database is a sample database representing a digital media store. The database contains tables for customers, invoices, artists, albums, tracks, and more.

### Key Tables:
- `Track`: Contains information about the tracks (songs) sold in the store.
- `Album`: Contains information about albums.
- `Artist`: Contains information about artists.
- `Customer`: Contains customer details.
- `Invoice`: Contains purchase information.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQL_Assignment_Project.git


## SQL Queries Included
 
- `Track Data Queries`: Retrieve tracks sorted by length, price, and more.
-  `Customer Spending Analysis`: Analyze how much each customer spent, identifying high spenders.
-  `Track and Album Information`: Retrieve track names, album titles, and artist information.
-   `Advanced Queries`: Includes finding top purchased tracks, album lengths, and customer orders.
